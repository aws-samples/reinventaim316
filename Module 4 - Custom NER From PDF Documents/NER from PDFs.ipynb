    "A powerful feature in AWS Comprehend is custom NER. This allows us to find certain key values in documents without having to build custom matching scripts or parsing through large quantites of documents. We have multiple options on AWS to build a custom NER model. The first is through flat data txt or csv files with the entity name and value. This method supports <strong>Synchronous and Asynchronous</strong> calls. The other method and the method we will be doing in this module is custom NER from native document types, this method currently only supports ***Asynchronous*** calls. This method becomes especially powerful as it takes into account spatial information in a document to improve inference. \n",
